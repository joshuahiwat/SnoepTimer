SNOEP timer
===================

SNOEP stands for `Synchrone Niet Onderbroken Effectieve Periodes`, which is Dutch for `Synchronous Uninterrupted Effective Periods`. It's a method derived from the famous [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) that synchronizes the pomodoro timeboxes within a team, so that work and breaks are aligned and hopefully more useful.

This timer is a simple tool to make it easier to synchronize the timeboxes.
